Hey, I've been infatuated by
a poem that goes like this:
"A slumer did my spirit seal.
I had no human fears.
She seemed a thing,
that could not feel the touch
of earthly years.
No motion has she now,
she neither hears nor sees."
it's a poem of a man who has
lost his beloved woman to death.
